/*1.Print an Integer Value : Create an int variable, assign it any number, and print it. Keep it simple, just show how to display
                         the value on the screen
  2.Print a Double Value : Declare a double variable, give it a value like 3.14, and print it. Show how to handle decimal
       numbers in Java.
  3. . Character Example : Use a char to store a single letter or symbol (e.g., 'A' or '#') and print it. Test with different
       characters to see the result.
  4.Boolean Basics : Create a boolean variable with a value of true or false, and print it. This will help you understand
      how true/false logic works in Java.
  5.Working with Float : Declare a float variable, assign it a value like 1.23f (don’t forget the f!), and print it
  6. Using Integer Wrapper Class : Create an Integer object, assign a number, and print its value. Notice how it’s different from
using a regular int.
 7. Double Wrapper Class : Do the same as the previous question but with the Double wrapper class. Assign a decimal
number and print it.
 8. Character Wrapper Example : Create a Character object, store a single character, and print it. Try using the Character class
methods to explore more.
 9.Boolean Wrapper Example : Use the Boolean class to create an object with true or false. Print the value to see how it’s
stored
